# SalesPal Application Fixes

## Issue 1: Port 5000 Conflict
The backend server was unable to start because port 5000 was already in use. Fixed by:
1. Changing the backend port from 5000 to 5001
2. Updating the frontend Vite configuration to use the new port
3. Creating an improved launch script with better error handling

## Issue 2: JavaScript Error in UploadSale.jsx
Fixed the "ReferenceError: parsedData is not defined" error in the upload functionality by:
1. Adding the missing `parsedData` state variable to the component
2. Properly initializing and updating it throughout component lifecycle

## Issue 3: Login/Network Errors
Fixed the login and network errors by:
1. Updating all direct API calls in the frontend to use port 5001 instead of 5000
2. Modified API endpoints in:
   - AuthContext.jsx (login, register, user verification)
   - ChatBubble.jsx (conversations, messages)
   - UploadSale.jsx (file upload, sale submission)

## How to Start the Application
To start SalesPal properly:

1. First, stop any existing processes and clear ports:
   ```
   ./stop-app.sh
   ./fix-ports.sh
   ```

2. Then start the application with the new launch script:
   ```
   ./launch-app-fixed.sh
   ```

The application now runs with:
- Frontend on port 5173
- Backend on port 5001

## Desktop Application
Fixed the desktop shortcut icon by:
1. Updating the SalesPal.desktop file on the desktop to point to the new launch-app-fixed.sh script
2. Ensuring the desktop file has executable permissions
3. Creating a symlink from launch-app.sh to launch-app-fixed.sh for compatibility
4. Verified both desktop files (in the application directory and on desktop) are properly configured

## Additional Improvements Made
1. Fixed syntax errors in server.js (escaped exclamation marks in conditionals)
2. Added better error handling for port conflicts in the backend server
3. Updated port references across configuration files for consistency
4. Added proper state management for the upload functionality
5. Updated all direct API endpoints to use the new port
